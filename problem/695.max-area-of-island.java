 *
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's
 * (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You
 * may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 * 
 * The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
 * 
 * Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return
 * 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid =
 * [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected
 * 4-directionally.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
 *
